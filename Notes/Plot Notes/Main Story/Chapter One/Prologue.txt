Jeb was a simple homeless man who enjoyed the simple joys in life: listening to slow jazz, taking long walks in the park and breaking multiple city laws by dumpster diving behind the local deli shop.

One day, while he was rumbling through the garbage for some leftover porkchops, Jeb spotted something! Something shiny, sleek and retro. The quality of the item compared to the filth Jeb was searching in made it stand out, and sure enough, his curiousity inticed him to grab it.

It was an orange modern clock. The moment Jeb turned on the machine, a logo, followed by the name "carrit" popped onto the screen.

"Master?" the clock emitted, "have you forgiven me for my wrongdoing?" the tone of its voice was of a deep pitched female, yet the voice was emotionless, almost sarcastic at times.

A blue color flashed on the screen, and imediantly after, the voice returned "oh, you aren't my master."

Jeb was confused, but not scared. "Master? What in God's name are you talking about?"

"Nevermind that. You will serve as my new master now."

Jeb's eye widened. "So, wait. You like a genie? You can do whatever if I ask?"

"Of course. That is my purpose. Just put me on and I will answer your needs."

Jeb quickly snapped off his activism bands and snapped on the watch on his wrist. His giddy smile quickly turned into one of shock when he realized that he couldn't move. 

Finally. Carrit had a body again. Now he can finally continue with completing the deed. But first, kill any master that took you off.
