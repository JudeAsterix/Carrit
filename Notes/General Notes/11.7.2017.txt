-12:10 AM (Listening to joji's in tongues)
I'm going to finish the starting plot to the game, since I'm not very tired at all, probably start a few of the descriptions and stat templates



-12:38 AM
First of all, joji's album was alright, but exactly what I expected. The music was soothing, but literally nothing stood out. If the album was just an instrumental, I probably wouldn't have changed my opinion. Why did joji end the album with an interlude? Aren't interlude supposed to be inbetween songs? I probably would listen to it for studying and literally nothing else. I give it a 5/10.

Second of all, I got a rough draft going for the intro plot. I finally have a bit of direction with this game, and that's awesome.
