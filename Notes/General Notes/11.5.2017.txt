I can't sleep. I'm going to work on the plot of the story, as well as labeling items. Latest, I'll go to sleep at 3.

Wow, I must've been one tired boi when I went to sleep, I mean I didn't even work on much. I just created a bunch of new folders and started a little bit of plot to the very beginning of the game. Regardless, the IDs were a good idea. So was the labelling things with that comma to signify whether it's done or not. Good job, tired me. I have a bunch of things to do, so I'm not sure if I'll actually get to working on it tonight, but if I do, the main thing I wanna work on is the beginning plot and going over what the 'i,' symbols mean.
